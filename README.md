### Workshop 1: 21/02/2023

In the beginning we prepare our workspaces for development by installing:

1.  **NodeJS**: You can dowload it from [Node JS download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

    - Check if the NodeJS is correctly installed by running next command in terminal:

      ```sh
      node -v
      ```

    - This would also install npm, you can check your version with:

      ```sh
      npm -v
      ```

2.  **Yarn**: After downloading Node, we install with command:
    ```sh
    npm i -D yarn
    yarn -v
    ```

First workshop introduces React components. We learn how to divide app into components, prepare basic component structure of the app.

> :warning: **This repo was created after first workshop**: I made some folder structure changes, added some stylings (which are not the things we would like to focus in this series). Everything can be trackable via commit logs.

### Workshop 2: 07/03/2023
